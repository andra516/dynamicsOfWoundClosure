## Dynamics of Wound Closure in Active Nematic Epithelia: Mathematica Code

This is the repository storing the Mathematica notebooks required to perform calculations detailed <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.04922>.

Users wishing to reproduce calculations and results from scratch should run the notebooks in the following order:

1. problemSetup.nb

2. order0Calculation.nb

3. order1Calculation.nb

Finally, 

4. shapeNumerics.nb

contains the necessary code to reproduce plots. Users wishing to just reproduce plots should run `shapeNumerics.nb`.
